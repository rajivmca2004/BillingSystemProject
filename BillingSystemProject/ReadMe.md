 ============================ Problem - Billing System ============================ 
 
 On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
 1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount 
 2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount 
 3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount. 
 4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount). 
 5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries. 
 6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill. 
 
 Write a program with test cases such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount using Test driven Development (TDD) approach.
 
 Important Guidelines:
---------------------

1. This project has been developed using Core Java 1.6 and JUnit 4 testing framework.
2. Please run this application by running Junit test classes. Location: / BillingSystemProject / src / test / billing
3. You can also run test suite 'AllTests.java' and check code coverage using Emma Code coverage Eclipse plug-in.
4. Development approach - TDD (Test junit first and then write code to pass the tests.
5. There is no GUI. It's a console based sample source code.
